[00:10.23] この手で触れた希望
[00:15.64] 外れた幼い足の音
[00:21.34] 階段に響く鼓動 理想にもたれて
[00:26.82] 消えそうな光を映した
[00:31.82] 
[00:32.77] 指導者が唱えても 僕の位置からズレて
[00:38.48] 記憶の周りで遊んでる
[00:43.90] 例えなど教えても 逃げてしまう焦りのよう
[00:49.54] 取り替えれない昨日たち ここから
[00:57.54] 
[00:54.90] WALK
[00:56.27] She's calling a timeout to say
[00:59.76] 'I won't hurry no more,
[01:02.77] No matter how they think about me'
[01:05.97] WALK
[01:07.23] You never have to be framed
[01:10.60] There's no limit to go
[01:13.43] Counting every step you take
[01:16.60] (Wow) I won't hurry no more,
[01:24.22] No matter how they think 'bout me
[01:27.63] (Wow) There's no limit to go
[01:35.34] Let me walk the right way
[01:47.84] 
[01:38.44] We never know the truth of lies
[01:43.81] Everyone makes it a rule of white lies
[01:49.26] Is that for me or for you
[01:51.68] To keep from hurting our prides？
[01:54.96] If we could rid ourselves from vanities
[02:14.46] 
[02:00.49] They pushed me out,
[02:02.27] Then knocked me out
[02:03.75] But smiled as if nothing was done
[02:06.48] We did not see eye to eye
[02:12.04] Their point of view is nothing new
[02:14.72] We've been completely poles apart
[02:17.62] And had no time to rewind
[02:20.78] But who minds？
[02:27.78] 
[02:22.77] WALK
[02:24.24] She's calling a timeout to say
[02:27.76] 'I won't hurry no more,
[02:30.75] No matter how they think about me'
[02:34.24] WALK
[02:35.40] You never have to be framed
[02:38.76] There's no limit to go
[02:41.51] Counting every step you take
[02:45.07] (Wow) I won't hurry no more,
[02:52.53] No matter how they think 'bout me
[02:56.38] (Wow) There's no limit to go
[03:03.91] Let me walk the right way
[03:16.41] 
[03:06.94] So let me walk on,
[03:09.42] Or I'll slip through your hands
[03:11.91] I won't hurry no more,
[03:14.76] No matter how they think 'bout me
[03:17.96] Don't let me look back,
[03:20.15] I'm looking straight ahead
[03:22.91] There's no limit to go
[03:25.97] We ain't going the same way
[03:39.47] 
[03:29.22] WALK
[03:30.89] She's calling a timeout to say
[03:33.93] 'I won't hurry no more,
[03:37.12] No matter how they think about me'
[03:40.47] WALK
[03:41.79] You never have to be framed
[03:45.00] There's no limit to go
[03:47.91] Counting every step you take
[03:51.02] (Wow) I won't hurry no more,
[03:59.12] No matter how they think 'bout me
[04:02.40] (Wow) There's no limit to go
[04:10.19] Let me walk the right way
